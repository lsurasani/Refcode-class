:20px; color:black;">            As a child, growing up in Ethiopia, we didn't have a computer at all and had no idea what exactly computer was. In 2006, with my three
     siblings and our father, we moved to Canada to live with our stepmom. I went to high school starting from grade 9. One of my classes was a computer class which was a mandatory.
Back then I wasn't interested in knowing more about computers rather than just being able to type faster than my classmates. I remember the first day of my comuputer class, completely oblivious
of what my classmates used to do. Some of them were on hotmail chatting with friends and I thought I can just go to the hotmail in google and start chatting (God knows who I would've been chatting with!).
<p> when my math teacher voluntarily taught how to make  games  using computers after school, I have always used to wonder how they do all those animations, and build websites
but never attended the class because I thought it is too hard for me to learn it. The other reason I lost hope in learning computer was the language barrier. I came to Canada with no English language skills
and I remember always trying to avoid people so they don't ask me questions and I do not know what to say back to them.</p>

<p> I got married to my amazing husband in 2013 who is a U.S citizen. I graduated from highschool in 2010 and started Universtiy in 2011. Since I was not interested in the program I was taking (Health administrative),
I took a year off and started going to college for dental assisting level II program. The overall program was very interesting and I graduated with honor in 2014.
I have always being a person who wants to learn and know how things work, and learning how the computer function was one of them. I had my first child in October 2015 and the second chile in September 2017.
My husband sponsered me to U.S and now I am living in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p> Since I became home-stay mother, my flexibility for learning and working has became too tight. My family member told me about Career Hub
when I was looking for part-time job. There is where I found out about this amazing computer coding program given by very amazing, helpful, and caring instructor and TAs. I was very excited and joined the team without
hesitation. I have been having some obstacles attending the class but, I have promised not to give up and try my best as much as I can to complete and be proud of myself. Fortunately, everyone in this program has been very
helpful which keeps my hopes up all the time. I have came to this so far, learned what html, css, and java scrip is and what they also do. I am still learning and knowing what it is like to be a web developer.</p>
